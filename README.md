# Background

I just started working at Centaur in January 2015. My task is to develop/manage a remote team for Centaur to expand our software
development team. I was an investment banker, working for Goldman Sachs, but my heart is still with coding. I used to head a 
team of a few junior analysts, covering tech industry. I developed a few iPhones app and want to go back to the world where I do
not have to wear suit everyday. Nevertheless, I am not that technical compared to most of you.

# Feedback

I welcome any feedbacks on the way we are going to work or the project specifications. I hope you would be patient in explaining
to me anything that I might lack
